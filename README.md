Here I create a tetris game in different environments:

* ExpoGo: allows tetris to be run on web and as app.
* StreamlIt: publishes the app to the web using python programming code.
* Phaser3: Game Engine, html and js only. Lightweigth, can be run from gitHub pages
* AppScript: run Tetris in Google Sheets

* learned to appreciate Phaser3, it's a 2D game engine which does not need anything but JS and HTML, so you can even publish your game on gitHub pages
* modern browsers require a user interaction before they start playing audio
* learned to appreciate GitHub pages, it allows you to host a html/js site
* learned the command npx http-server it allows you to export a directory as if it was the root of an http server, you can find it on port 8080 then
* created favicon as svg. SVG is a cool format, human-readable scaleable.
* learned how to debug this favicon I always had issues with. Just type F12 -> Network in your browser and you may see a 404
* saw a 404 for favicon, had to replace /favicon.svg with favicon.svg as I was exporting the stuff from docs/ in gitHub pages
* had to use CTRL_R to refresh the browser
