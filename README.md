Here I create a tetris game in different environments:

* ExpoGo: allows tetris to be run on web and as app.
* StreamlIt: publishes the app to the web using python programming code.
* Phaser3: Game Engine, html and js only. Lightweigth, can be run from gitHub pages
* AppScript: run Tetris in Google Sheets
